                    		Every Monday of my sophomore year, I'd fulfill my long regimen of going to class, finishing homework, getting laundry done, and hitting the gym. Around 7PM, after most everyone else on campus had finished dinner and headed back to their dorms or the CULC to study, a group of passionate nerds and I would meet in an unused cramped room at the top floor of the CoC.<br /><br />
                    		Each week, as CTF captain, I created a set of computer security related <a href="oldsite/greyhat.html" target="_blank">problems</a> and posted them on my website. Together, we would work in groups to solve these problems and learn something new about the vast world of computer security. And thus went the GreyHat CTF meetings of 2015-2016.<br /><br />

                		<p>
                    		Of all the things I did sophomore year, CTF meetings were probably my favorite. I worked with an amazing group of students ranging from your typical Computer Science students to even Mechanical Engineers. The small space we shared fostered a very positive environment in which we all helped each other learn. Without any input from me, the students formed groups to tackle my problems together and I cannot describe to you what an amazing feeling it is to see the relieved looks on their faces when they finally solve a problem after an hour of struggling through it. It was exactly that exhilirating feeling that led me to love computer security in the first place, and I was thrilled that I succeeded in passing this feeling on.

                <h4>CSAW CTF Experience</h4>
                <div class="row">

                		<p>
                    		In the fall, we decided to compete online in the annual CSAW CTF Competition. We reserved our usual room, made pancakes and scrambled eggs to fuel us through, and called in some alumni (like the legendary Chris Grayson) for a whole weekend of hacking fun.<br /><br />
                    		Somehow, by the end of the weekend, our Georgia Tech team ended up in 57th place out of 1367 teams in the competition. As it turned out, though, our team was 13th among the top 15 teams that qualified to go to the finals in New York City - so we did!<br /><br />
                    		At CSAW finals, three others and I worked through a 36 hour non-stop hacking session on the problems we were given. While we jammed out to music and munched through an endless supply of free food for competitors, we solved many problems and learned many things. You can download a write-up for one of the problems I solved by clicking <a href="presentations/11-16-15_CSAW'15_Forensics_Problem.zip">here</a>.<br /><br />
                    		We didn't win at the end of the competition but I did have one of the most fun hacking experiences of my life. It was an amazing feeling to be surrounded by so many intelligent people whose expertises cover such a wide field. I highly recommend anyone interested in security at all to get their hands dirty with CTFs; they're super fun and you will imbibe more knowledge than you could have imagined.

                			In the spring of 2016, GreyHat as a club decided to revive its annual CTF competition. We opened up the competition to undergraduate and masters students so that we could cater to the widest range of students possible without giving too much of an edge to higher level students.<br /><br />
                			Overall, it was a great success. The competition received sponsorship from Capital One, which generously provided us with a $400 prize pool and even bought Moe's catering and snacks for the competitors. As members of GreyHat's board, Manas George, Max Bires, and I authored a list of puzzles to be solved during the competition. We set up an instance of RootTheBox using AWS and let everyone work on the problems for a good 6-8 hours. Congratulations go to Jonathan Chen for winning first place in the competition.<br /><br />
                			If you're curious about the difficulty and types of problems in the competition, <a href="resources/greyhat/CTF-Problems.zip" target="_blank">here </a> you can find the problems I wrote for the competition. I usually have written the solutions in the "difficulty.txt" file. They were generally intended to be beginner to intermediate level problems, with some difficult ones thrown in to make sure no one completed every problem.<br /><br />
                			Overall, everyone seemed to enjoy our CTF competition and you could visibly see the frustration on their faces as the competition was coming to close and competitors were stuck on a problem. It was a good kind of frustration; the kind that you learn from. I'm looking forward to doing something like this again next year.<br />
