# [Jail Escapes](/jail-escapes)
Some problems involve running commands in a shell or interpreter with some character limitations. Here I detail some of the things you can do to bypass these restrictions that I've seen in previous CTFs.

# [Exploit Initscript](/binexploit-init)
Binary exploit problems generally involve sending data to a binary and interpreting the output. This script uses the pwntools framework to automate much of the setup.

# [Payloads for Binaries](/binary-payloads)
In pwn challenges, we often need to send exact byte-value payloads to processes or remote services to exploit them. Here are a few tips and reminders when attempting to do this.

# [GDB Tips](/gdb-tips)
GDB is a powerful tool, but it can be easy to forget some of its basic commands when the commands can be so esoteric. Here, I've compiled a few useful tips and tricks I've come across while using GDB.

# [Python](/python)
High level languages can sometimes perform unexpectedly due to the way data types are interpreted. Here, I've compiled a few of the things I've come across specifically for Python.

# [Format String Attacks](/format-strings)
Here's a handy reference for attacking format string vulnerabilities.
