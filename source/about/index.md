## About Me

I'm currently a software engineer at Microsoft working in Azure Security. Before that, I did my undergrad at Georgia Tech and masters at UC Santa Barbara.

At work, I make [confidential computing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/overview) accessible to the world by enabling remote enclave attestation in Azure. At home, I enjoy reverse engineering binaries and exploiting vulnerable services in hacking competitions called CTFs.

When I'm not on a computer, you might find me playing board games with friends or trying to find the best Thai food in town. I love connecting with people so please feel free to reach out, even just to say hello!
