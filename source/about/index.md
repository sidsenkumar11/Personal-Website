## About Me

I'm currently a software engineer at Microsoft working in Azure Security. Before that, I did my undergrad at Georgia Tech and masters at UC Santa Barbara.

I love learning about all things computers, but I'm particularly passionate about computer security. I've spent more than a few weekends reverse engineering binaries, exploiting vulnerable services, and messing with SQL injections through hacking competitions called CTFs.

When I'm not on a computer, you might find me watching anime, playing board games with friends, or trying to find the best Thai food in town. I love connecting with people so please feel free to reach out, even just to say hello!
